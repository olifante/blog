  __content: '\n<p>The article <a title="A Tiny Revolution: How America Works" href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000478.html#more">A Tiny Revolution: How America Works</a> gives an interesting insight into the level of inbreeding of american elites, but what really cracked me up was one of the comments:</p><blockquote><p>As I like to say, the Democrats and Republicans have generally\nrepresented the sane evil people and the insane evil people,\nrespectively. Their long-running argument goes like this:\n\n</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>REPUBLICANS:</strong> Let\'s kill everyone and take their money!<br />\n<strong>DEMOCRATS:</strong> I like the way you\'re thinking. I really do. But if we keep\nat least SOME of them alive and working for us, we can make even MORE\nmoney in the long run!<br />\n<strong>REPUBLICANS:</strong> You commie!</em></p></blockquote>\n\n' }
