On the Java course I taught a couple of weeks ago, we decided to try out the NetBeans 4.1 Beta version, and I have to say I was impressed. Last time I looked, NetBeans was large, ugly and klunky. It now sports a slick interface, built-in goodies such as unit testing with jUnit and refactoring tools, and it also feels a lot more agile, although sometimes window repaint rates fell somewhat short of expectations. I also felt that it was much easier to get into than Eclipse (although I still haven\'t tried the 3.x series). NetBeans almost makes Java look sexy again.</p>\n\n' }
