  __content: '\n<p>I\'ve been kind of silent lately, for several reasons:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Blogs are hard to maintain, but strangely addictive, in an obsessive-compulsive sort of way. Somehow I find it liberating to be freed from the need to post every day. Maybe that\'s the only way to have a regular audience, as some say, but Google seems to be my main reader and it seems to be more interested in quality than quantity of production;</li>\n\n<li>I\'ve grown tired of simply being a linkblog that only comments on what others do and adds no real original value;</li>\n\n<li>Increasingly, I feel the need to *do* things instead of *talking about* things, although my personal inclination is usually for the latter. Blogging is fun, but how much does it accomplish?</li>\n\n<li>I\'ve been spending a lot of time learning a few new things, such as spoken Mandarin Chinese, the Ruby programming language, and the poster child of the year, the Ruby on Rails web development platform;</li>\n\n<li>I\'ve been doing a lot of training and some contracting work lately, most of it related to Sun\'s Java Enterprise System, with a sprinkling of J2EE, Java programming and Sun Cluster. Lots of information to refresh/assimilate/update, not much time left for writing;</li>\n\n<li>Several ideas about starting my own business keep coming back to haunt me. Maybe I should&nbsp; unglue my eyeballs from the web and do something about it.</li></ol>\n\n' }
