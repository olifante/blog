My PayPal account is now â‚¬39 ($48) lighter.</p>\n\n<p>Another step taken towards the consumation of my affair with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. Forgive me, Python, my love, I will always hold a place for you in my heart -- but Ruby is so young and sexy it makes me wanna jump with joy.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, Ruby sucks for Unicode. Yes, its strings are mutable. Yes, its libraries are by no means as large and mature. Yes, it has no list comprehensions.</p>\n\n<p>But it gives me blocks instead of crippled lambdas. And real OOP with real methods and attributes, not some clever hack emulating classes with dictionaries and functions. And it\'s just so darned elegant!</p>\n\n<p>Did I mention how great <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is? Yes, dear, I\'m afraid you never quite could make up your mind when it came to web development. What about TurboGears and Django, you say? Too late for me, dear -- Rails rocks, and it\'s already got critical mass. </p>\n\n<p>Farewell <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>, my dear friends. I promise to visit whenever I drop by Windowsland.</p>\n\n' }
