  __content: '\n<p>If you like vikings, roadies, drunks, transformers and electric guitar duels, you\'ll love the insane music video for Jason Forrest\'s <a href="http://www.cockrockdisco.com/JFDSwpweb.mov" target="_blank">War Photographer</a>: </p>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.cockrockdisco.com/JFDSwpweb.mov" target="_blank"><img border="0" alt="Warphotographer_1" title="Warphotographer_1" src="http://olifante.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/warphotographer_1.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>\n\n\n<p>Since I don\'t watch TV, I found this video through a list a friend sent me of the <a href="http://docopenhagen.blogspot.com/2005/12/top-50-music-videos-of-2005.html">Top 50 Music Videos of 2005</a>, which I\'ve been slowly exploring. So far, the War Photographer is for me the best of the bunch. White Stripe\'s <a href="http://stream.qtv.apple.com/qtv/v2music/whitestripes/denialtwist_ref.mov">Denial Twist</a> is also wonderfully done, and a few others are also quite imaginative, but none have made me laugh out loud and compulsively press replay.</p>\n\n' }
