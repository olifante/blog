He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer in ten minutes by expending 0.75 calories. Man on his feet is thermodynamically more efficient than any motorized vehicle and most animals. [...]</p>\n<p>\nMan on a bicycle can go three or four times faster than the pedestrian, but uses five times less energy in the process. He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer of flat road at an expense of only 0.15 calories. [...] Equipped with this tool, man outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well.</p>\n</cite></blockquote>\n\n' }
