  __content: '\n<p>I finally managed to get Apple\'s <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/x11/x11.en.html#intro.def-x11">X11</a> to work, after several X11-less weeks.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a long story: After installing the last Safari update using Apple\'s Software Update, I was no longer able to login with any of my Powerbook\'s accounts. The only way I found to solve the login problem without wasting a lot of time was to do an Archive &amp; Install, keeping my user\'s folders and applications. This was a first for me - I usually prefer to do clean installs, but happily it worked like a cinch. In next to no time I had a fresh install of MacOS X Tiger up and running, and all I had to do was patch the base install. Fortunately I usually choose Software Update\'s &quot;Keep and Install&quot; option, so I didn\'t even have to download the updates. All my docs and apps were preserved, apart from the Developer Tools (with X11), which I had to re-install from DVD.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, whenever I tried to run X11 it crashed immediately. The crash.log in /Users/username/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/X11.crash.log mentioned the following error:</p><blockquote><p>Library not loaded: /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib<br />Referenced from: /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11<br />Reason: image not found</p></blockquote><p>I was able to live without X11 for a while, but yesterday I needed an image editor to do a simple screen-capture touch-up, and after some research I knew I had to get X11 working in order to use the Gimp. I googled around, and eventually found that I just had to install X11User from /Volumes/Mac OS X Install/DVD/System/Installation/Packages/X11User.pkg (Tiger installation DVD). As a former Sun colleague used to say, &quot;Problem solve, case close&quot; (sic).</p>\n\n' }
