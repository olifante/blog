  __content: '\n<p>AsiaSource has a <a href="http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/lieven.cfm" title="America Right or Wrong: AsiaSource Interview with Anatol Lieven">fascinating interview</a> with Anatol Lieven in which he discusses several themes underlying his recent book, <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195168402/">America, Right or Wrong</a>. The interview is filled to the brim with quotable stuff. Here are some snippets:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the invasion of Iraq:</strong><br />\n\n</p><blockquote><p>Iraq has been a disaster for their aims. They have gotten away\nwith it of course in that they have been re-elected but it is perfectly\nobvious that they cannot launch another war of choice, another invasion\nof Iran, say. They simply do not have the troops. With almost 150,000\nmen pinned down in Iraq, they could not launch another war on that\nscale without introducing conscription. That would tear American\nsociety apart and for the first time since Vietnam lead to a\nsignificant anti-imperialist movement in this country. It would also,\nfor the first time, lead to really serious questions about what America\nis doing in the Middle East at all.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On China Containment:</strong></p><blockquote><p>[...] [O]bviously they would still very much like to\ndestroy China if they could, or at least destroy China as a potential\nfuture threat to American hegemony. But as long as they are tied down\nin the Middle East in the way they are, they will not have the military\nforces to do so.\n</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I believe that the Bush administration and future\nDemocrat administrations will continue the existing line. That said of\ncourse there is always room for mistakes either on the part of\nWashington or of Beijing or of Taipei or most likely of all three\nsimultaneously. The Taiwanese can go too far, and the Chinese can\noverreact, not because the Chinese want war but because they would trap\nthemselves into a position where they would have to do something. [...] [T]hen the US, and particularly the American Congress, have put\nthemselves in such a position that they would be forced to fight as\nwell.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On the odds of an attack on Iran:</strong></p><blockquote><p>It is still a possibility. Not I believe such a strong\npossibility now because apart from everything else the Iranians do seem\nvery anxious to play along with Europe, and are willing at least to\nsuspend their nuclear weapons plans in response to a mixture of\nEuropean pressure and incentives with American threats. But if America\nwere to attack Iran, it would be a catastrophe. Poor old Tony Blair has\naccepted so many shattering blows already maybe nothing will finish\nhim, but having invested so much in this process with Iran, if it were\nto end in an American attack, it seems likely that there would be a\nserious revolt within his government and party and he would have to\nresign. There are leading members of the British government briefing in\nprivate that whatever Tony Blair says, if America attacks Iran, that is\nthe end. They will resign. This would almost certainly be the end of\nBlair\'s tenure as prime minister. It would also create a massive crisis\nwith the Europeans. Moreover, given the fact that Iran\'s nuclear sites\nare dispersed and buried, America would very likely <em>miss</em>, at\nwhich point we will have the worst of all possible worlds. As the\nAmerican military know very well, Iran in these circumstances would\nhave numerous means of retaliation against American forces and plans in\nIraq - whereas an American invasion of Iran looks impossible because of\nAmerica\'s lack of troops.\n</p>\n\n<p>[...] It is not inconceivable that there could emerge some disastrous <em>quid pro quo</em>\nwhereby Israel will make certain concessions towards the Palestinians\nand in return America go after Iran\'s nuclear weapons. But of course\nthe consequences might be frightful because of course Iran would then\nhave every incentive to try to really destabilize Iraq. Hezbollah could\nbe reactivated as an international terrorist force. Iran would set out\nto destabilize Afghanistan, and so forth and so on.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On the affinity between Christian fundamentalism and Zionism:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If one just looks at the Christian fundamentalist issue, leaving\nthe millenarian question aside, American evangelical Protestantism is\nOld Testament Protestantism - just as its forbearers in English radical\nProtestantism and Scottish radical Protestantism were in the 16th and\n17th centuries. This creates a natural affinity with the Jewish\nreligious tradition. When evangelical Christian Lieutenant-General\nWilliam Boykin was quoted last year as saying, &quot;My God is bigger than\nhis,&quot; in reference to a Muslim, he was directly citing from Isaiah and\nthis is obviously a man who spends a lot of his time in the Old\nTestament. </p>\n\n<p>It is fascinating the degree to which the Old Testament\neclipses the New Testament in the thought of evangelical Christians and\nthis automatically leads one to a sympathy with Israel. </p></blockquote><p><strong>On civil service and academia:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I used to think that it is wonderful that the American state can\nrecruit from people in academia but I have come to find it deeply\ncorrupting. I almost prefer the British system now, of career civil\nservants who serve one administration after another. But one needs a\nstrong ethos of the independence of the civil service and a very strong\nethos that people cannot be sacked or penalized for political views as\nlong as they maintain the discipline of their service. This actually\nleaves the public debate in the UK freer than in the US, particularly\nin the strange, solipsistic world of Washington DC. It is amazing in a\nrepublic with a strong tradition of individualism and cultural\negalitarianism, that in DC the sense of hierarchy, of sometimes\nobsequious deference, of the court game, who is in, who out, dominates\neverything just as much as it did in an early medieval court. It does\ncontribute to this lack of debate in America.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Empires end by suicide, not murder:</strong></p><blockquote><p>[...] [I]f the Bush administration were feeling suicidal, and were actually\nin the mood to throw itself over a cliff, like the Hapsburgs in 1914,\nthere are a number of ways it could do that. It could invade Iran, that\nwould do it very quickly. Or it could invade Saudi Arabia. Or it could\nsupport Taiwanese independence. I don\'t believe they will actually do\nany of those things. Unfortunately, one can much more easily imagine\nthe Bush administration doing something like bombing Iran, which would\nnot lead to immediate disaster but which could begin a spiral of\nretaliation leading ultimately to catastrophic conflict.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n' }
