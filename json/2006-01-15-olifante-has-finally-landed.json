  __content: '\n<p>...on the surface of <a href="http://planet.taoofmac.com/">Planet Tao of Mac</a>, a site run by <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/RuiCarmo">Rui Carmo</a> that aggregates content from more than a dozen tech-centric bloggers. Greetings, fellow Planet-Tao-of-Mac\'ers! It\'s an honour to be in such great company.</p>\n\n<p> Rui is also the man behind <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space">Tao of Mac</a>, for my money the best tech-oriented blog/wiki in Portugal and probably the most internationalized Portuguese blog. I discovered only recently that the Planet is open for immigration, as long as applicants fulfil the <a href="http://planet.taoofmac.com/about.php">stringent admission criteria</a>, namely being Mac users who grok Unix.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing as I\'ve been a Mac user ever since 2001, when my iBook became for a short time a head-turning sensation at Sun Microsystems Portugal, I decided on a whim to ask Rui to join in, to which he quickly and courteously said something like &quot;Sure. Send me a mugshot and you\'re in in 5 minutes.&quot; There was much joy and merriment in no place in particular, but unfortunately my current blogging hibernation period continued even after entering the Planet\'s orbit.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>For several reasons I haven\'t been adding much lately to my own blog, the venerable <a href="http://olifante.blogs.com/">Olifante\'s Lair</a> (open for business since 2003), but I now intend to turn up the heat once more and try to keep up with the quality and frequency of updates I see on the Planet.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I\'m writing this post from a\nbrand new iMac G5 17&quot;. My wife and I were fed up with all the junk and\nidiotic behaviour accumulated by her parents\' Windows PCs in between our visits from Lisbon to Viana do Castelo, and decided to move them to something sane: a Mac.</p>\n\n<p>Since we weren\'t able to spend Christmas together, it was only this weekend that we managed to visit and present them with their shiny new toy. They were suitably awed -- I know I would be: it\'s gorgeous and I want one!</p>\n\n<p>The new iMac features are quite handy. Photo Booth was great for some quick family fun with the integrated iSight, and the remote command turned out to be pretty handy when we did a photo slideshow of their recent vacations in Brazil.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like a boy scout who has just turned the world into a happier, safer place.</p>\n\n' }
