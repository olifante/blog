Felizmente que Sharon e outros defensores dos direitos humanos se apressaram a condenar estas intoleráveis preocupações com o povo terrorista palestiniano:</p>\n<blockquote><cite><p>\n"You are pouring oil on the fire of our enemies," Mr Sharon was quoted by Y-net news agency as telling Mr Lapid. \n</p><p>\n"These are grave things that should not have been said," Shaul Mofaz, the defence minister added. "This is the harshest possible statement about the security forces of the state of Israel. I request a retraction." \n</p></cite></blockquote>\n<p>Entretanto há rumores de que um certo <a href="http://jornal.publico.pt/2004/05/13/EspacoPublico/O01.html">Vice-presidente do Parlamento Europeu</a> se prepara para revelar que Lapid, que muitos julgavam ser um honesto cidadão e bom pai de família, é afinal um <a href="http://jornal.publico.pt/2004/05/20/EspacoPublico/O01.html">Olimpiano</a>.\n\n' }
