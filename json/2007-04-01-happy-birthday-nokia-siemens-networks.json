It\'s been a great 10 months, and I\'m eager to discover how the sinergies generated by the merger can help us jump ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, it\'s no coincidence that my <a href="http://olifante.blogs.com/covil/2006/05/programming_lan.html">last post</a> was written more than 10 months ago, roughly 20 days before I joined Siemens Portugal. The effort of diving into my new job left me little energy for blogging. I now intend to resume blogging on a regular basis, for some undefined value of regular.</p>\n\n' }
