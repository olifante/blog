Bruno has sent me an invitation to open a Flick Pro account for free,
and being the greedy bastard that I am I immediately accepted. I'd heard
lots of praise for Flickr, but I hadn't really had the time to explore.
Now that I have, I can see what all the fuss is about. It's an amazing
web application, and I can easily imagine using it for all my photo
publishing.\
\
I've uploaded around a hundred low-res computer generated images,
created using the amazing [Drawbot] (now [NodeBox]).\

Here's looking at you, Bruno. Thanks a bunch!\
