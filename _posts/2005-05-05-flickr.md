I'd heard lots of praise for Flickr, but I hadn't really had the time to explore. Now that I have, I can see what all the fuss is about. It's an amazing web application, and I can easily imagine using it for all my photo publishing.<br /><br />I've uploaded around a hundred low-res computer generated images, created using the amazing <a href="http://drawbot.com/">Drawbot</a> (now <a href="http://nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>).<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/olifante/sets/302650/">some of my favorite drawbot images</a>.<br /><br />Here's looking at you, Bruno. Thanks a bunch!<br /><br />(Note: all pictures were designed and created by me. All rights reserved)</p>
