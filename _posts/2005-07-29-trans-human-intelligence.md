Wired magazine's August issue has a fascinating article by [Kevin
Kelly], one of its founders and board member of the VERY forward-looking
[Long Now Foundation]. The subject is the web, or rather the emergence
of the global Machine, the collective aggregate of humans, transistors
and bits that forms a giant artifical intelligence, or rather a
trans-human intelligence. The idea in itself is far from new, but the
article is interesting all the same. Here are some quotes:

> The fetal Machine has been running continuously for at least 10 years
> (30 if you want to be picky). I am aware of no other machine - of any
> type - that has run that long with zero downtime. While portions may
> spin down due to power outages or cascading infections, the entire
> thing is unlikely to go quiet in the coming decade. It will be the
> most reliable gadget we have.
>
> And the most universal. By 2015, desktop operating systems will be
> largely irrelevant. **The Web will be the only OS worth coding for**.
> It won't matter what device you use, as long as it runs on the Web OS.
> You will reach the same distributed computer whether you log on via
> phone, PDA, laptop, or HDTV.
>
> \[...\]
>
> The human brain has no department full of programming cells that
> configure the mind. Rather, brain cells program themselves simply by
> being used. Likewise, our questions program the Machine to answer
> questions. We think we are merely wasting time when we surf mindlessly
> or blog an item, but **each time we click a link we strengthen a node
> somewhere in the Web OS, thereby programming the Machine by using
> it**.
>
> \[...\]
>
> There is only one time in the history of each planet when its
> inhabitants first wire up its innumerable parts to make one large
> Machine. Later that Machine may run faster, but there is only one time
> when it is born.
>
> **You and I are alive at this moment.**
>
> We should marvel, but people alive at such times usually don't. Every
> few centuries, the steady march of change meets a discontinuity, and
> history hinges on that moment. We look back on those pivotal eras and
> wonder what it would have been like to be alive then. Confucius,
> Zoroaster, Buddha, and the latter Jewish patriarchs lived in the same
> historical era, an inflection point known as the axial age of
> religion. Few world religions were born after this time. Similarly,
> the great personalities converging upon the American Revolution and
> the geniuses who commingled during the invention of modern science in
> the 17th century mark additional axial phases in the short history of
> our civilization.
>
> Three thousand years from now, when keen minds review the past, I
> believe that our ancient time, here at the cusp of the third
> millennium, will be seen as another such era. In the years roughly
> coincidental with the Netscape IPO, humans began animating inert
> objects with tiny slivers of intelligence, connecting them into a
> global field, and linking their own minds into a single thing. This
> will be recognized as the largest, most complex, and most surprising
> event on the planet. Weaving nerves out of glass and radio waves, our
> species began wiring up all regions, all processes, all facts and
> notions into a grand network. From this embryonic neural net was born
> a collaborative interface for our civilization, a sensing, cognitive
> device with power that exceeded any previous invention. The Machine
> provided a new way of thinking (perfect search, total recall) and a
> new mind for an old species. It was the Beginning.
