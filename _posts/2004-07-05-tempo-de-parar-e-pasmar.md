<blockquote><cite>
<p>
What is this life if, full of care,<br/>
we have no time to stand and stare.
</p><p>
No time to stand beneath the boughs<br/>
and stare as long as sheep or cows.
</p><p>
No time to see, when woods we pass,<br/>
where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
</p><p>
No time to see, in broad daylight,<br/>
streams full of stars, like skies at night.
</p><p>
No time to turn at Beauty's glance,<br/>
and watch her feet, how they can dance.
</p><p>
No time to wait till her mouth can<br/>
enrich that smile her eyes began.
</p><p>
A poor life this if, full of care,<br/>
we have no time to stand and stare.
</p><p>
William Henry Davies
