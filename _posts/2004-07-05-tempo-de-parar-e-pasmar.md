> What is this life if, full of care,\
> we have no time to stand and stare.
>
> No time to stand beneath the boughs\
> and stare as long as sheep or cows.
>
> No time to see, when woods we pass,\
> where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.
>
> No time to see, in broad daylight,\
> streams full of stars, like skies at night.
>
> No time to turn at Beauty's glance,\
> and watch her feet, how they can dance.
>
> No time to wait till her mouth can\
> enrich that smile her eyes began.
>
> A poor life this if, full of care,\
> we have no time to stand and stare.
