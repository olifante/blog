InfoWorld has a short article with the results of a study of [Open
Source Database Market Share Breakdown]. Here's the ranking:

1.  <span class="artText">MySQL -- 53% </span>
2.  <span class="artText"> Firebird -- 52% </span>
3.  <span class="artText"> PostgresSQL -- 15%</span>
4.  <span class="artText"> Berkeley DB -- 4%</span>
5.  <span class="artText"> GNU SQL -- 3%</span>
6.  <span class="artText"> SAP DB -- 1%</span>
7.  <span class="artText"> Other -- 6%</span>

I'm surprised to see Firebird (formerly Borland/Inprise Interbase) is so
close to MySQL. I had no idea it was that popular. I never heard of GNU
SQL, so I'll have to check it out, but I was surprised to see that
SQLite was not explicitly represented.

For more info on Open Source Databases, check out
[][]<http://debianlinux.net/databases.html> and
[][1]<http://cbbrowne.com/info/rdbmssql.html>. Some notable absences are
[Metakit] (non-SQL embeddable DB) and of course [ZODB] (an OODBMS
written in Python). Python fans might also be interested in [Gadfly], an
SQL Relational DB written in Python.
