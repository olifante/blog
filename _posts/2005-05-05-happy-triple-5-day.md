The date today is 05-05-05, the only date this year which looks the same
in the american (mm/dd/yy), european (dd/mm/yy) and [ISO 8061]
(yy-mm-dd) date formats. By the way, ISO dates rule! When sorted
lexicographically, ISO dates automatically are sorted chronologically.

Quick, someone invent a new Whatever-Day to sell more stuff to people on
phony pretexts. Or maybe elect \#-\#-\# as an international day for
US-European-World Harmony. Thinking again, that might mean World War III
beginning in 2013 and lasting until 2100, so perhaps we'd better not.
