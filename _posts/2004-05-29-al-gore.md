O Al Gore fez ante-ontem um [discurso arrasador] sobre a política
externa da Administração Bush. O discurso está alojado numa página da
[MoveOn PAC], que o descreve da seguinte forma:

> Former Vice President Al Gore delivered a major foreign policy address
> in New York City May 26, sponsored by MoveOn PAC, linking the Abu
> Ghraib prison abuses to deep flaws in President Bush’s Iraq policy and
> calling for the resignation of 6 members of the Bush Administration
> team responsible for the failed policy and abuse of prisoners in Iraq.
> Gore identified the various ways in which all Americans—soldiers in
> Iraq, residents and travelers abroad, and citizens at home—are
> endangered by the bitterness created throughout the Islamic world—and
> beyond—by US policy.

O discurso é sóbrio, lúcido e detalhado nas acusações que faz e nas
conclusões que tira. Alguns excertos:

> Private Lynndie England did not make the decision that the United
> States would not observe the Geneva Convention. Specialist Charles
> Graner was not the one who approved a policy of establishing an
> American Gulag of dark rooms with naked prisoners to be "stressed" and
> even - we must use the word - tortured - to force them to say things
> that legal procedures might not induce them to say.
>
> \[...\]
>
> Donald Rumsfeld, as the chief architect of the war plan, should resign
> today. His deputies Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and his intelligence
> chief Stephen Cambone should also resign. The nation is especially at
> risk every single day that Rumsfeld remains as Secretary of Defense.
>
> Condoleeza Rice, who has badly mishandled the coordination of national
> security policy, should also resign immediately.
>
> George Tenet should also resign. I want to offer a special word about
> George Tenet, because he is a personal friend and I know him to be a
> good and decent man. It is especially painful to call for his
> resignation, but I have regretfully concluded that it is extremely
> important that our country have new leadership at the CIA immediately.
>
> \[...\]
>
> These horrors were the predictable consequence of policy choices that
> flowed directly from this administration's contempt for the rule of
> law. And the dominance they have been seeking is truly not simply
> unworthy of America - it is also an illusory goal in its own right.
>
> Our world is unconquerable because the human spirit is unconquerable,
> and any national strategy based on pursuing the goal of domination is
> doomed to fail because it generates its own opposition, and in the
> process, creates enemies for the would-be dominator.
>
> A policy based on domination of the rest of the world not only creates
> enemies for the United States and creates recruits for Al Qaeda, it
> also undermines the international cooperation that is essential to
> defeating the efforts of terrorists who wish harm and intimidate
> Americans.
>
> \[...\]
>
> Our future is dependent upon increasing cooperation and
> interdependence in a world tied ever more closely together by
> technologies of communications and travel. The emergence of a truly
> global civilization has been accompanied by the recognition of truly
> global challenges that require global responses that, as often as not,
> can only be led by the United States - and only if the United States
> restores and maintains its moral authority to lead.
