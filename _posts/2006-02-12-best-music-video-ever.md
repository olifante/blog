If you like vikings, roadies, drunks, transformers and electric guitar
duels, you'll love the insane music video for Jason Forrest's [War

Since I don't watch TV, I found this video through a list a friend sent
me of the [Top 50 Music Videos of 2005], which I've been slowly
exploring. So far, the War Photographer is for me the best of the bunch.
White Stripe's [Denial Twist] is also wonderfully done, and a few others
are also quite imaginative, but none have made me laugh out loud and
compulsively press replay.
