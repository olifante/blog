<blockquote><cite><p>
AN ISRAELI minister threw a cabinet session into uproar yesterday when he said footage of an elderly Palestinian woman sifting through the rubble of her house in Rafah Refugee Camp reminded him of his grandmother, who was a Holocaust victim. 
</p><p>
Justice minister Yosef Lapid, head of the centrist Shinui party, did not explicitly mention the Holocaust in his remarks, which were part of a call for a halt to the house demolitions that have left about 1,500 Palestinians homeless over the last ten days in what the army says is a bid to curb smuggling of weapons from Egypt into Gaza through tunnels. 
</p><p>
"It isn’t human, it isn’t Jewish and it causes us tremendous damage in the world," Mr Lapid said of the demolitions. 
</p>
</cite></blockquote><p>
É caso para perguntar: Ministro Yosef Lapid, porque é que odeia Israel? Felizmente que Sharon e outros defensores dos direitos humanos se apressaram a condenar estas intoleráveis preocupações com o povo terrorista palestiniano:</p>
<blockquote><cite><p>
"You are pouring oil on the fire of our enemies," Mr Sharon was quoted by Y-net news agency as telling Mr Lapid. 
</p><p>
"These are grave things that should not have been said," Shaul Mofaz, the defence minister added. "This is the harshest possible statement about the security forces of the state of Israel. I request a retraction." 
</p></cite></blockquote>
<p>Entretanto há rumores de que um certo <a href="http://jornal.publico.pt/2004/05/13/EspacoPublico/O01.html">Vice-presidente do Parlamento Europeu</a> se prepara para revelar que Lapid, que muitos julgavam ser um honesto cidadão e bom pai de família, é afinal um <a href="http://jornal.publico.pt/2004/05/20/EspacoPublico/O01.html">Olimpiano</a>.
