[Uproar as Israeli MP shows pity for Palestinian woman]

> AN ISRAELI minister threw a cabinet session into uproar yesterday when

> rubble of her house in Rafah Refugee Camp reminded him of his
> grandmother, who was a Holocaust victim.

> Justice minister Yosef Lapid, head of the centrist Shinui party, did

É caso para perguntar: Ministro Yosef Lapid, porque é que odeia Israel?
Felizmente que Sharon e outros defensores dos direitos humanos se
apressaram a condenar estas intoleráveis preocupações com o povo
terrorista palestiniano:

> "You are pouring oil on the fire of our enemies," Mr Sharon was quoted
> by Y-net news agency as telling Mr Lapid.
>
> "These are grave things that should not have been said," Shaul Mofaz,
> the defence minister added. "This is the harshest possible statement
> about the security forces of the state of Israel. I request a
> retraction."

Entretanto há rumores de que um certo [Vice-presidente do Parlamento
Europeu] se prepara para revelar que Lapid, que muitos julgavam ser um
honesto cidadão e bom pai de família, é afinal um [Olimpiano].
