Since last Wednesday, Firefox 1.5 binaries for Solaris are at last
available directly from Mozilla's ftp site, both in [compressed tarball]
format and, more conveniently, in [pkgadd] format.

  [compressed tarball]: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/contrib/solaris_tar_ball/
  [pkgadd]: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/contrib/solaris_pkgadd/
