The Commission on Federal Election Reform has made the full text of
their [final report] available in pdf format.

Electronic voting machines are usually highly appreciated by voters, but
few are aware of [how difficult] it is to make those machines
tamper-proof. The only way to make electronic voting machines at least
as auditable as standard paper ballots is to make sure that they
generate a [paper trail]. In other words, the computer prints a ballot
with your vote, [you inspect it] and cast it in the ballot box if it is
correct. Although votes are counted as soon as they are generated, the
ballots are still available for manual audits or recounts, and always
take precedence over the digitally recorded vote.

Unfortunately, most implementations of electronic voting eschew paper
trails, using higher costs as a smokescreen to hide the utter insanity
of making the democratic process essentially unauditable and thus
undemocratic. How cheap do you want your democracy to be?
