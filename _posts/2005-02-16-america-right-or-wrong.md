<p>AsiaSource has a <a href="http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/lieven.cfm" title="America Right or Wrong: AsiaSource Interview with Anatol Lieven">fascinating interview</a> with Anatol Lieven in which he discusses several themes underlying his recent book, <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195168402/">America, Right or Wrong</a>. The interview is filled to the brim with quotable stuff. Here are some snippets:</p>

<p><strong>On the invasion of Iraq:</strong><br />

</p><blockquote><p>Iraq has been a disaster for their aims. They have gotten away
with it of course in that they have been re-elected but it is perfectly
obvious that they cannot launch another war of choice, another invasion
of Iran, say. They simply do not have the troops. With almost 150,000
men pinned down in Iraq, they could not launch another war on that
scale without introducing conscription. That would tear American
society apart and for the first time since Vietnam lead to a
significant anti-imperialist movement in this country. It would also,
for the first time, lead to really serious questions about what America
is doing in the Middle East at all.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On China Containment:</strong></p><blockquote><p>[...] [O]bviously they would still very much like to
destroy China if they could, or at least destroy China as a potential
future threat to American hegemony. But as long as they are tied down
in the Middle East in the way they are, they will not have the military
forces to do so.
</p>

<p>Therefore, I believe that the Bush administration and future
Democrat administrations will continue the existing line. That said of
course there is always room for mistakes either on the part of
Washington or of Beijing or of Taipei or most likely of all three
simultaneously. The Taiwanese can go too far, and the Chinese can
overreact, not because the Chinese want war but because they would trap
themselves into a position where they would have to do something. [...] [T]hen the US, and particularly the American Congress, have put
themselves in such a position that they would be forced to fight as
well.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On the odds of an attack on Iran:</strong></p><blockquote><p>It is still a possibility. Not I believe such a strong
possibility now because apart from everything else the Iranians do seem
very anxious to play along with Europe, and are willing at least to
suspend their nuclear weapons plans in response to a mixture of
European pressure and incentives with American threats. But if America
were to attack Iran, it would be a catastrophe. Poor old Tony Blair has
accepted so many shattering blows already maybe nothing will finish
him, but having invested so much in this process with Iran, if it were
to end in an American attack, it seems likely that there would be a
serious revolt within his government and party and he would have to
resign. There are leading members of the British government briefing in
private that whatever Tony Blair says, if America attacks Iran, that is
the end. They will resign. This would almost certainly be the end of
Blair's tenure as prime minister. It would also create a massive crisis
with the Europeans. Moreover, given the fact that Iran's nuclear sites
are dispersed and buried, America would very likely <em>miss</em>, at
which point we will have the worst of all possible worlds. As the
American military know very well, Iran in these circumstances would
have numerous means of retaliation against American forces and plans in
Iraq - whereas an American invasion of Iran looks impossible because of
America's lack of troops.
</p>

<p>[...] It is not inconceivable that there could emerge some disastrous <em>quid pro quo</em>
whereby Israel will make certain concessions towards the Palestinians
and in return America go after Iran's nuclear weapons. But of course
the consequences might be frightful because of course Iran would then
have every incentive to try to really destabilize Iraq. Hezbollah could
be reactivated as an international terrorist force. Iran would set out
to destabilize Afghanistan, and so forth and so on.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On the affinity between Christian fundamentalism and Zionism:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If one just looks at the Christian fundamentalist issue, leaving
the millenarian question aside, American evangelical Protestantism is
Old Testament Protestantism - just as its forbearers in English radical
Protestantism and Scottish radical Protestantism were in the 16th and
17th centuries. This creates a natural affinity with the Jewish
religious tradition. When evangelical Christian Lieutenant-General
William Boykin was quoted last year as saying, &quot;My God is bigger than
his,&quot; in reference to a Muslim, he was directly citing from Isaiah and
this is obviously a man who spends a lot of his time in the Old
Testament. </p>

<p>It is fascinating the degree to which the Old Testament
eclipses the New Testament in the thought of evangelical Christians and
this automatically leads one to a sympathy with Israel. </p></blockquote><p><strong>On civil service and academia:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I used to think that it is wonderful that the American state can
recruit from people in academia but I have come to find it deeply
corrupting. I almost prefer the British system now, of career civil
servants who serve one administration after another. But one needs a
strong ethos of the independence of the civil service and a very strong
ethos that people cannot be sacked or penalized for political views as
long as they maintain the discipline of their service. This actually
leaves the public debate in the UK freer than in the US, particularly
in the strange, solipsistic world of Washington DC. It is amazing in a
republic with a strong tradition of individualism and cultural
egalitarianism, that in DC the sense of hierarchy, of sometimes
obsequious deference, of the court game, who is in, who out, dominates
everything just as much as it did in an early medieval court. It does
contribute to this lack of debate in America.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Empires end by suicide, not murder:</strong></p><blockquote><p>[...] [I]f the Bush administration were feeling suicidal, and were actually
in the mood to throw itself over a cliff, like the Hapsburgs in 1914,
there are a number of ways it could do that. It could invade Iran, that
would do it very quickly. Or it could invade Saudi Arabia. Or it could
support Taiwanese independence. I don't believe they will actually do
any of those things. Unfortunately, one can much more easily imagine
the Bush administration doing something like bombing Iran, which would
not lead to immediate disaster but which could begin a spiral of
retaliation leading ultimately to catastrophic conflict.</p></blockquote>
