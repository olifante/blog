A fortunate coincidence meant that the [MIT Press Bookstore Loading Dock
Sale] took place on the same weekend as [Startup School]. When I say
fortunate, I mean fortunate for the bookstore owners: I came out 10
books heavier and \$60 lighter. These are the books I got suckered into
buying:

![][9]  ]  

As if this wasn't enough to make me wonder how much I would be paying in
excess baggage fees, between visits to Borders and Barnes & Nobles in
downtown Boston I still managed to buy another 3 books:

The Head First Design Patterns book is currently the best-selling item
in the Amazon.com Java section. I already knew that the book was quite,
errr, unorthodox, but I was surprised all the same when I saw how tall
and thick it is. I was also a bit disappointed when I started leafing
through it: it looks like a book written for teenagers. I bought it
anyway, thanks to all the rave reviews, and when I started reading some
of first chapters I actually found its irreverent style very effective.
In spite of what all the funky graphics might imply, the book is packed
with information AND very understandable. Another very accessible
patterns book is "Design Patterns Explained", which I've lent to several
people with good success.

As for the Martin Fowler book, it's brilliant, or rather, it's
brilliantly simple. This is a must-have introduction and reference for
people who want to get into Software Architecture. Its first 100 pages
present in a very compact but readable form the major concepts and
problems of enterprise application development. The remaining pages
present a detailed catalog of mostly architecture patterns. Maybe I'm
exagerating, but I think the book is worth the price just for the
100-page intro, which basically lays out a common language for
discussing most important concepts, problems and solutions of software
architecture. I wish I had this book a few years ago.
