<p><a href="http://www.belightsoft.com/products/imagetricks/overview.php">Image Tricks</a> and <a href="http://www.rhapsoft.com/">LiveQuartz Image Editor</a> are two free image editors for MacOSX 10.4 that provide a graphical front-end to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/coreimage/">Tiger Core Image filters</a>. Image Tricks is simple but useful: it allows you to apply a sequence of filters to whole images. LiveQuartz is a bit more powerful, although the interface is not immediately intuitive. It goes beyond multiple effects, featuring layers and basic image editing with a small palette of tools.<br /> </p>
