[Image Tricks] and [LiveQuartz Image Editor] are two free image editors
for MacOSX 10.4 that provide a graphical front-end to the [Tiger Core
Image filters]. Image Tricks is simple but useful: it allows you to
apply a sequence of filters to whole images. LiveQuartz is a bit more
powerful, although the interface is not immediately intuitive. It goes
beyond multiple effects, featuring layers and basic image editing with a
small palette of tools.\
