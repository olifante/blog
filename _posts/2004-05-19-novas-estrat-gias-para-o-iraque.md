<p>Embora não concorde com algumas das premissas e conclusões, o artigo <a title="Strategic Forecasting, Inc." href="http://www.stratfor.com/corporate/index.neo?page=basicsample">Iraq: New Strategies</a> constitui uma leitura interessante. O autor George Friedman é o director da Stratfor, uma agência privada de análise geopolítica.</p>
<blockquote><cite><p>
The United States must begin by recognizing that it cannot possibly pacify Iraq with the force available or, for that matter, with a larger military force. It can continue to patrol, it can continue to question people, it can continue to take casualties. However, it can never permanently defeat the guerrilla forces in the Sunni triangle using this strategy.</p><p>[...]</p><p>
This means the goal of reshaping Iraqi society is beyond the reach of the United States. Iraq is what it is. The United States, having performed the service of removing Saddam Hussein from power, cannot reshape a society that has millennia of layers. The attempt to do so will generate resistance -- while that resistance can be endured, it cannot be suppressed.</p></cite></blockquote>
