Nancy Pelosi não tem papas na língua no que toca a Bush. O [SFGate] tem
um [artigo] repleto de frases demolidoras desta Democrata americana:

> Bush is an incompetent leader. In fact, he's not a leader, he's a
> person who has no judgment, no experience and no knowledge of the
> subjects that he has to decide upon.
>
> \[...\]
>
> He has on his shoulders the deaths of many more troops, because he
> would not heed the advice of his own State Department of what to
> expect after May 1 when he ... declared that major combat is over. The
> shallowness that he has brought to the office has not changed since he
> got there.
>
> \[...\]
>
> Not to get personal about it, but the president's capacity to lead has
> never been there. In order to lead, you have to have judgment. In
> order to have judgment, you have to have knowledge and experience. He
> has none.
>
> \[...\]
>
> This president has demonstrated very clearly that he does not have the
> capacity to present a plan to transition.
>
> \[...\]
>
> The only way we can get more troops from other countries is to have a
> president who respects the other countries. It's hopeless for George
> Bush. He has made it hopeless.

O artigo termina com a opinião de Pelosi sobre as hipóteses de Bush
ganhar as próximas eleições:

> He's gone. He's so gone.
