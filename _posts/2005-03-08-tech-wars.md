Rui Carmo has started a list of [common (tech) religious wars], inviting
further suggestions. Off the top of my head, here's some additional holy
wars that haved scarred and maimed untold generations of geeks and
nerds:

-   zsh vs. bash (formerly bash vs. ksh, formerly formerly ksh vs. csh)
-   Ruby vs. Python (formerly Python vs. Perl)
-   Rails vs. PHP
-   Dynamic vs. Static typing
-   Interpreted vs. Compiled
-   JSP vs. Servlets, now resolved into BOTH, but nobody cares anymore
-   Stored Procedures vs. In-code SQL massaging
-   IDEs vs. Customizable Text Editors
-   Agile vs. XP Programming
-   XHTML vs. HTML 4
-   CSS vs. XSLT
-   XPath vs. XQuery
-   SAX vs. DOM parsing
-   RelaxNG vs. XML Schema (formerly XML Schema vs. DTD)
-   Imperative vs. Functional programming languages
-   .Net vs. Java platform
-   C\# vs. Java (formerly Java vs. C++)\
-   Haskell vs. O'Caml
-   Lisp vs. Scheme
-   Smalltalk vs. Lisp, now resolved into BOTH
