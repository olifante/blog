This is the list of my current favorite extensions:

[![Firefox15rc3extensions]]

The snapshot is taken from the [All-in-One Sidebar] extension panel,
sorted using [Sort Extensions]. All extensions are compatible with the
Firefox 1.5 Release Candidate 3. Among recent additions, the [View
Rendered Source Chart] extension is a-ma-zing! It let's you browse the
source code for a page using an innovative colored block technique that
makes it much easier to understand how things are organized. [HOST.info
Geolocation Plugin] is simple but quite nice - it's strangely comforting
to be able to see where in the planet the links are going to. It's a bit
scary to see how my Firefox extension "habit" is growing into a fully
fledged addiction...
