On [Who cares about OS], Andy McKay talks about the fact that the choice
of OS is becoming increasingly irrelevant. I couldn't agree more.

I guess working for Sun Microsystems got me over my Windows addiction.
Five years of daily Solaris use for every single computing task made me
learn and gradually love many alternative tools, most of them free/open
source. Maybe that's the reason why the switch to MacOSX was so painless
for me: I didn't get a hangover from my missing toys, since I was able
to take them with me to my shiny new OS.

The browser and mail client have replaced Word and Excel as the
applications I use the most. I confess I still use Mail.App instead of
Thunderbird, but that's mostly for convenience. Mail.App is a very
advanced mail client, and excellent as Thunderbird is, it didn't exist
when I moved to MacOSX, and Mozilla was shite on MacOSX. In spite of
Apple's Safari being an excellent browser, I still prefer Firefox,
mostly due to its utter extensibility and most of all its portability.
Firefox is excellent on Windows but also runs admirably well on other
systems.

The last few months I've been teaching several Sun classes using Solaris
machines for trainer and trainees alike. Installing Firefox on Solaris
is a snap: get the correct archive from
[][]<http://sunfreeware.com/mozilla.html>, and a "tar xvf
firefox-1.0-sparc-sun-solaris2.8.tar.gz" later you're set to go.

Of course, life in Firefox-land would be drab and meaningless without my
favorite ~~applications~~ [extensions]. Fortunately, all of my must-have
extensions run without problems on Windows, MacOSX and Solaris:

-   Adblock (don't forget to add the [advanced filters], especially the
    [dailies])
-   Mouse Gestures (made me love the mouse again)
-   Mozilla Amazon Browser (amazing example of the power of XUL)
-   Web Developer
-   Gmail Notifier
-   Google Pagerank Status
-   googlebar
-   Download Statusbar
-   downTHEMall!
-   Tabbrowser Preferences
-   TargetAlert

On Solaris I still haven't tested other extensions I enjoy, like
Linkification, Slogger, Magpie, del.icio.us, Live HTTP Headers,
ViewSourceWith, ConQuery and CookieCuller, but since extensions are
written in standard Javascript + XUL, there's every reason to expect
them to perform correctly.

The other applications I spend significant time using are:

-   iTunes (best music player/organizer on any platform, bundled with
    MacOSX)\
-   iCal (calendar application bundled with MacOSX)
-   Address Book (contact manager bundled with MacOSX)
-   iChat (instant messaging client bundled with MacOSX)
-   iPhoto (excellent photo organizer bundled with MacOSX)\
-   Terminal (bundled with MacOSX)
-   Preview (pdf viewer bundled with MacOSX)
-   Adobe Acrobat Reader (free pdf viewer)
-   zsh (open source shell on steroids)\
-   Python (open source programming language - batteries included!)\
-   Vim (open source text editor - hate it then love it)
-   Drawbot (fun open source programmable planar graphics with python)
-   Quicksilver (unbelievably wonderful free program switcher!)
-   Acquisition (excellent shareware gnutella client, most enjoyable P2P
    client for ANY platform)
-   Azureus (open source BitTorrent client)
-   iGetter (download manager)
-   iEatBrainz (free mp3 identifier)
-   Colloquy (free IRC client)
-   MPlayer OS X 2 (free movie player)
-   VLC (free movie player)

Not all of these are multi-platform, but of those that are, most are
free, like iTunes (Windows and MacOSX only), Adobe Acrobat Reader, zsh,
python, Vim, Drawbot, Azureus, MPlayer and VLC. The other applications
usually have some free equivalent in other operating systems.
