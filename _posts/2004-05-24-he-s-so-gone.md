<p>Nancy Pelosi não tem papas na língua no que toca a Bush. O <a href="http://sfgate.com/">SFGate</a> tem um <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/05/20/MNGK36OR7L1.DTL">artigo</a> repleto de frases demolidoras desta Democrata americana:</p>
<blockquote><cite>
<p>Bush is an incompetent leader. In fact, he's not a leader, he's a person who has no judgment, no experience and no knowledge of the subjects that he has to decide upon.</p>
[...]
<p>He has on his shoulders the deaths of many more troops, because he would not heed the advice of his own State Department of what to expect after May 1 when he ... declared that major combat is over. The shallowness that he has brought to the office has not changed since he got there.</p>
[...]
<p>Not to get personal about it, but the president's capacity to lead has never been there. In order to lead, you have to have judgment. In order to have judgment, you have to have knowledge and experience. He has none.</p>
[...]
<p>
This president has demonstrated very clearly that he does not have the capacity to present a plan to transition.</p>
[...]
<p>The only way we can get more troops from other countries is to have a president who respects the other countries. It's hopeless for George Bush. He has made it hopeless.</p>
</cite></blockquote>
<p>
O artigo termina com a opinião de Pelosi sobre as hipóteses de Bush ganhar as próximas eleições:
</p>
<blockquote><cite>He's gone. He's so gone.</cite></blockquote>
