[Sun updates NetBeans open source tools platform - Yahoo! News].

NetBeans is getting an upgrade next Monday to version 4.1. On the Java
course I taught a couple of weeks ago, we decided to try out the
NetBeans 4.1 Beta version, and I have to say I was impressed. Last time
I looked, NetBeans was large, ugly and klunky. It now sports a slick
interface, built-in goodies such as unit testing with jUnit and
refactoring tools, and it also feels a lot more agile, although
sometimes window repaint rates fell somewhat short of expectations. I
also felt that it was much easier to get into than Eclipse (although I
still haven't tried the 3.x series). NetBeans almost makes Java look
sexy again.
