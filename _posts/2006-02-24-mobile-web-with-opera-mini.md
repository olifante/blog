<p>It's now one month since <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/forums/topic.dml?id=121042">Opera Mini</a> became available for free worldwide. As soon as the good news reached me, I went and checked the <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/phones/">list of supported devices</a> to to see if my phone was supported, and luckily my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_K750i">SEK750</a> is beefy enough to allow me to use Opera Mini Advanced (MIDP2).</p>

<p>To install it, I had to get two files: opera-mini-advanced.jar (~100KB) and opera-mini-advanced.jad (&lt;1KB). Using a Mac means installation is pretty simple: use Bluetooth File Exchange to browse the phone, navigate to /Phone Memory/Other and drop the files there. Then go to &quot;Menu &gt; File Manager &gt; Other&quot; and choose install.</p>

<p>Although my phone was already configured to browse the web with the SEK750's built-in browser, Opera Mini wasn't able to access the web until I went to &quot;Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings for Java&quot; and selected the &quot;Internet&quot; profile that I previously created.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots I took using the <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/demo.dml">Opera Mini simulator</a>:</p>
