It's now one month since [Opera Mini] became available for free
worldwide. As soon as the good news reached me, I went and checked the
[list of supported devices] to to see if my phone was supported, and
luckily my [SEK750] is beefy enough to allow me to use Opera Mini
Advanced (MIDP2).

To install it, I had to get two files: opera-mini-advanced.jar (\~100KB)
and opera-mini-advanced.jad (&lt;1KB). Using a Mac means installation is
pretty simple: use Bluetooth File Exchange to browse the phone, navigate
to /Phone Memory/Other and drop the files there. Then go to "Menu &gt;
File Manager &gt; Other" and choose install.

Although my phone was already configured to browse the web with the
SEK750's built-in browser, Opera Mini wasn't able to access the web
until I went to "Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Settings for
Java" and selected the "Internet" profile that I previously created.

Here are some screenshots I took using the [Opera Mini simulator]:
