Although Safari, the standard MacOSX browser, is one of the best
browsers out there, I still stick to Firefox for most of my browsing
needs. The reason is simple: extensions. Firefox is simply the most
extendable browser of all, and the number of extensions is staggering.
Between test-drives and must-haves, I regularly have 10 to 20 extensions
loaded. These are my current Firefox extensions:

1.  [AdBlock] with [AdBlock Filterset.G Updater][AdBlock] - must-have
    (instructions [here])
2.  [NoScript] - must-have
3.  [Down Them All]
4.  [Linkification] - simple and useful
5.  [ShowIP] - simple and useful
6.  [All-in-one Mouse Gestures] - requires some learning, but very
    addictive when you get the hang of it
7.  [ChromEdit]
8.  [Flashblock]
9.  [JustBlogIt]
10. [FlashGot]
11. [Tabbrowser Preferences]
12. [PDF Download] - simple and useful
13. [StumbleUpon] - lots of fun, huge timewaster
14. [Web Developer] - must-have
15. and last but not least, the [Google Toolbar] for Firefox

UnlikeÂ  most people, I never moved to Internet Explorer. When I started
working for Sun, in 1998, only a few sales and marketing types had
Wintel laptops. Everybody else got a Sun workstation running Solaris and
had to use Netscape for mail and web. I didn't exactly feel I was
missing out on anything until a couple of years later, when Netscape
4.7x started to look and feel hopelessly outdated. I moved to later
Netscape versions, but when it became apparent that Mozilla was usually
ahead of the "official" releases in most respects, I skipped over to
Mozilla as soon as it became reasonably stable under Solaris (around
0.8x, IIRC) and never looked back.

In 2001 I bought my first Mac, and kept on using Mozilla, although it
was a bit sluggish on MacOSX. I was happily married to the Mozilla suite
until I started hearing rumors about some annoying upstart that was
diverting people away from the "true path". I ended up trying Firefox,
and once I found it came configured by default with all the options I
used to have to choose manually in Mozilla, I left the Mozilla suite for
good. When Safari was released by Apple, I temporarily switched to it,
and although it is an excellent browser, I was by then too addicted to
bookmarking groups of tabs and using extensions. I now use Firefox for
most of my reading with ads and Javascript disabled, and use Safari for
searches and sites that need flash or java.

Lately I've been trying out Camino - a more Apple-ified version of
Firefox - and there's much to like, such as the easily acessible "Reset
Camino" menu option and the fact that it comes with built-in ad
blocking. Good as it is, however, I think it stands a pretty slim chance
of enticing mass desertions from the Firefox main branch, especially
once Firefox 1.5 comes out of beta.
