<p>Although Safari, the standard MacOSX browser, is one of the best browsers out there, I still stick to Firefox for most of my browsing needs. The reason is simple: extensions. Firefox is simply the most extendable browser of all, and the number of extensions is staggering. Between test-drives and must-haves, I regularly have 10 to 20 extensions loaded. These are my current Firefox extensions:</p>

<p>Unlike&nbsp; most people, I never moved to Internet Explorer. When I started working for Sun, in 1998, only a few sales and marketing types had Wintel laptops. Everybody else got a Sun workstation running Solaris and had to use Netscape for mail and web. I didn't exactly feel I was missing out on anything until a couple of years later, when Netscape 4.7x started to look and feel hopelessly outdated. I moved to later Netscape versions, but when it became apparent that Mozilla was usually ahead of the &quot;official&quot; releases in most respects, I skipped over to Mozilla as soon as it became reasonably stable under Solaris (around 0.8x, IIRC) and never looked back.</p>

<p>In 2001 I bought my first Mac, and kept on using Mozilla, although it was a bit sluggish on MacOSX. I was happily married to the Mozilla suite until I started hearing
rumors about some annoying upstart that was diverting people
away from the &quot;true path&quot;. I ended up trying Firefox, and once I found it came configured by default with all the options I used to have to choose manually in Mozilla, I left the Mozilla suite for good. When Safari was released by Apple, I temporarily switched to it, and although it is an excellent browser, I was by then too addicted to bookmarking groups of tabs and using extensions. I now use Firefox for most of my reading with ads and Javascript disabled, and use Safari for searches and sites that need flash or java.</p>

<p>Lately I've been trying out Camino - a more Apple-ified version of Firefox - and there's much to like, such as the easily acessible &quot;Reset Camino&quot; menu option and the fact that it comes with built-in ad blocking. Good as it is, however, I think it stands a pretty slim chance of enticing mass desertions from the Firefox main branch, especially once Firefox 1.5 comes out of beta.</p>
