<p>Today I stumbled upon an excellent essay proposing a new paradigm for software design:</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/">Magic Ink - Information Software and the Graphical Interface</a></p>

<p>Author Bret Victor argues we've been using Industrial Design as the wrong paradigm for software design. He splits user-facing software in three categories:</p>

<ul><li>Information Software</li>

<li>Manipulation Software</li>

<li>Communication Software</li></ul>

<p>He then proceeds to argue that &quot;<strong>Most software is information software</strong>&quot; and that &quot;<strong>Information software design is graphic design</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>The essay uses beautiful visual examples to show how Tufte's &quot;<strong>Show the Data</strong>&quot; principle can be used to reduce the need for interactivity in user-facing software.</p>

<p>Endearingly, his Movie Showings redesign example shows a movie called &quot;The Little Schemer&quot; with actors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_cdr">Car, Cdr</a>, Cons and Cond, a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the deservedly well-known <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">compsci classic book</a> of the same name:</p>
