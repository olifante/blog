**(scroll to bottom for Iain's reply to my nits with TweetDeck)**

Earlier today I [lamented on Twitter] that I get an error whenever I try
to favorite a tweet using [Twhirl] or [TweetDeck], my favorite and 2nd
favorite Twitter clients for OS X. Shortly after, a Iain Dodsworth
replied, pointing out that TweetDeck hasn't yet added the ability to
favorite tweets, so might I not be a tad mistaken?

Well, Iain turns out to be the TweetDeck creator, who apparently pays
close attention whenever the word TweetDeck is tweeted. So sorry, Iain,
I am indeed mistaken: while Twhirl gives me a "limit exceeded" error
whenever I try to favorite a tweet, TweetDeck doesn't yet have that
functionality. It does have a button labeled F which is currently greyed
out but which will presumably allow you to set favorites at some point.
So for the moment, I use Twitterrific on my iPhone whenever I really
want to favorite something.

Since I caught Iain's attention, I profitted from the occasion to send
him a message outlining some of the reasons why, much as I like some of
TweetDeck's functionality, I still prefer Twhirl. Here's the list of my
nits to pick with TweetDeck:

1.  Twhirl is more compact. In TweetDeck, all tweets take the same
    vertical space, regardless of whether they're one-liners
    or five-liners. This means I can see more Tweets in one Twhirl
    column than in TweetDeck. One simple way to regain vertical space
    would be to move the Reply/D/R/F buttons from below the pictures to
    the left or right of the pictures. Each tweet would now only be as
    high as the user's pics.

2.  Re-ordering groups with the move left/right buttons is cumbersome.
    Either implement drag-and-drop for column re-ordering or add a
    pop-up menu where you can drag the column names up and down to their
    desired positions, instead of having to move them one step at
    a time.

3.  The "All Tweets" column becomes less useful when you have created
    your own groups. Whenever I add someone to a group, I now see their
    tweets in two places. This might be the intended result for some
    people, but not for me. I don't have everyone I follow added to a
    group, only the ones I pay more attention to (friends,
    acquaintances, gurus). This means I have to filter the tweets I've
    already read when I scan the All Tweets columns for lower
    priority tweets. A simple workaround for this problem would be to
    create an "Ungrouped" column and allow me to use that instead of the
    "All Tweets" column.

4.  Allow me to fit more than one group in one column. I don't have
    TweetDeck running all the time, so some columns are empty or mostly
    empty much of the time, such as the "Direct Messages" one.

5.  Allow me to resize the width of each column, so I can fit more on
    the screen at the same time.

6.  When I click on one of the fast access buttons
    (Replies/Direct/Twitscoop/12seconds), do not add a duplicate column
    if one already exists.

7.  Allow me to mark a tweet as a favorite ;-)

Notwithstanding these nits, TweetDeck has several appealing features,
such as:

1.  Being able to place the people you're following to different groups
    and display each group in its own column.

2.  Built-in search, including the ability to create a self-updating
    search column (I presume this is how Iain found my tweet).

3.  Built-in URL shortening, with the ability to choose your favorite
    service (currently I mostly use <http://is.gd>).

4.  Built-in support for [TwitScoop], letting you see what are the
    "hottest" words being tweeted in the twittosphere.

5.  Built-in support for [12seconds.tv], a cross between twitter and
    seesmic, where instead of posting 140 character status updates you
    post 12 second videos. Haven't tried it out yet, though.

6.  **Update:** I forgot to mention one of TweetDeck's conveniences,
    which is the nifty Twitter API status indicator in the lower
    right-hand corner. This is useful whenever there's trouble in
    the twittosphere.

On the other hand, Twhirl has a few tricks of its own up its sleeve:

1.  Support for [Seesmic], which is currently the dominant video micro
    blogging platform. Nevertheless, I've tried Seesmic and found it a
    bit boring, with too many rambling monologues. Perhaps the 12 second
    limitation could prove as liberating as the Twitter 140
    character limit.

2.  Support for [friendfeed], Paul Bucheit's wonderful life
    feed aggregator.

3.  Ability to crosspost to [Pownce] and [Jaiku].\
    **Update:** I just checked out my Pownce account, and it seems like
    only some of the tweets sent using Twhirl are reaching Pownce, so
    this feature is only half-working (and I'm not talking about tweets
    sent via other clients, which of course won't be automatically
    crossposted to Pownce). I can't confirm whether the same happens
    with Jaiku, since I don't have an account there.

I really enjoy these last two features, so for the moment Twhirl has my
heart.

### 2008-09-22 Update -- Iain's reply

Iain replied via email 10 minutes after I sent him an email, but I was
busy writing this post so I didn't notice it. Here's his answers to my
nits:

1.  Twhirl is more compact\
    *Iain: removal of tweet buttons implemented in next version*

2.  Re-ordering is cumbersome\
    *Iain: due to be implemented in a near future version*

3.  "Ungrouped" column\
    *Iain: All Tweets column is removable in the next version, good idea
    on the ungrouped column - I'll get that implemented*

4.  More than one group in same column\
    *Iain: unused columns are removed from view in the next version*

5.  Resizable columns\
    *Iain: working on this - BUT I have to be careful to not ruin the
    look of TweetDeck, I've tried different height tweets and they
    completely ruin the feel*

6.  Buttons add duplicate columns\
    (this nit was missing from my first email to Iain, so no answer from
    him yet)

7.  Favorite tweets\
    *Iain: implemented in next version*
