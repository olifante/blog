<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox 1.5 beta 2</a> for the last two days and I love it. It actually feels more stable than 1.0.7, which tended to crash on me once in a while. Some of the highlights of the this release are:</p>

<ul><li>As with <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, there now is a quick away to instantly clean your browsing history, cached pages and cookies (use &quot;Clear Private Data&quot; under the &quot;Tools&quot; menu). Very useful for public web-browsing, web-development and married men.</li>

<li>Built-in integration with Gmail (&quot;Read Mail&quot; and &quot;New Message...&quot; under the &quot;Tools&quot; menu)</li>

<li>Drag-and-drop support for tabs - finally!</li>

<li>A totally redone preferences pane - not a moment too soon.</li>

<li>A new (and supposedly much better) updater - haven't tried it yet.</li>

<li>SVG support - check out the <a href="http://www.croczilla.com/svg/samples/">Croczilla SVG examples</a>.</li>

<li>Canvas support - check out the <a href="http://overstimulate.com/projects/canvas/">overstimulate</a> demos.</li></ul>

<p>If IE7 merely plays catch up to Firefox 1.0 when it is released, it's going to look pretty silly.</p>

<p>Some minor things have changed as well: instead of using Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab to switch between tabs, on MacOSX you now have to use Cmd-Option-Right and Cmd-Option-Left (as with Camino). Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn still work as usual, though. If like me you're a heavy tab user, you'll be happy to know that there's a new shortcut to bookmark all tabs: Cmd-Shift-D.</p>

<p>One of the problems of moving to the bleeding edge is that some of your extensions will stop working unless their authors have certified them for your current Firefox release. Here's the list of extensions I'm currently using:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=345,height=379,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://olifante.blogs.com/covil/images/firefox_15_extensions.png"><p><img border="0" src="http://olifante.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/firefox_15_extensions_1.png" title="Firefox_15_extensions_1" alt="Firefox_15_extensions_1" />
</p></a>

<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=722&amp;application=firefox">NoScript</a> - a must-have extension that lets you block any page from executing Javascript code. Forbids globally, allows selectively.</li>

<li><a href="http://bene.sitesled.com/adblock.htm">AdBlock Plus</a> with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1136">AdBlock Filterset.G Updater</a> - instructions <a href="http://www.extensionsmirror.nl/index.php?showtopic=774">here</a>). This must-have extension allows you to prevent pages from loading images for ads, thus reducing your bandwidth usage, your browser load and your cognitive load. Filterset.G simply performs regular updates of the ad-perpetrator blacklist and innocent-image-serving-sites whitelist.</li>

<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=60">Web Developer</a> - a must-have if you're into web development.</li>

<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=748">Greasemonkey</a> - the much-talked-about tweak-the-web extension that allows you to reconfigure any site to look and act the way YOU like it. If you're a &quot;power to the people&quot;/&quot;fuck the system&quot; kind of guy, this is the extension for you. Grab some ready-made scripts from <a href="http://userscripts.org/">userscripts.org</a> or read Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/">Dive into GreaseMonkey</a> to learn how to roll your own.</li>

<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=436">SessionSaver</a> - never quite got this one to work in Firefox 1.0.x, if it does work in 1.5b2 it will instantly become my most used extension. I routinely browse with more than 30 tabs open, and I'm getting tired of having to &quot;bookmark all tabs&quot; periodically.</li>

<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=743&amp;application=firefox">CustomizeGoogle</a> - haven't investigated this one yet, but it looks interesting.</li>
