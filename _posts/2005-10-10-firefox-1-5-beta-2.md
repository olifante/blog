I've been using [Firefox 1.5 beta 2] for the last two days and I love
it. It actually feels more stable than 1.0.7, which tended to crash on
me once in a while. Some of the highlights of the this release are:

-   As with [Camino], there now is a quick away to instantly clean your
    browsing history, cached pages and cookies (use "Clear Private Data"
    under the "Tools" menu). Very useful for public web-browsing,
    web-development and married men.
-   Built-in integration with Gmail ("Read Mail" and "New Message..."
    under the "Tools" menu)
-   Drag-and-drop support for tabs - finally!
-   A totally redone preferences pane - not a moment too soon.
-   A new (and supposedly much better) updater - haven't tried it yet.
-   SVG support - check out the [Croczilla SVG examples].
-   Canvas support - check out the [overstimulate] demos.

If IE7 merely plays catch up to Firefox 1.0 when it is released, it's
going to look pretty silly.

Some minor things have changed as well: instead of using Ctrl-Tab and
Ctrl-Shift-Tab to switch between tabs, on MacOSX you now have to use
Cmd-Option-Right and Cmd-Option-Left (as with Camino). Ctrl-PgUp and
Ctrl-PgDn still work as usual, though. If like me you're a heavy tab
user, you'll be happy to know that there's a new shortcut to bookmark
all tabs: Cmd-Shift-D.

One of the problems of moving to the bleeding edge is that some of your
extensions will stop working unless their authors have certified them
for your current Firefox release. Here's the list of extensions I'm
currently using:

[]

![Firefox\_15\_extensions\_1]

1.  [NoScript] - a must-have extension that lets you block any page from
    executing Javascript code. Forbids globally, allows selectively.
2.  [AdBlock Plus] with [AdBlock Filterset.G Updater] - instructions
    [here]). This must-have extension allows you to prevent pages from
    loading images for ads, thus reducing your bandwidth usage, your
    browser load and your cognitive load. Filterset.G simply performs
    regular updates of the ad-perpetrator blacklist and
    innocent-image-serving-sites whitelist.
3.  [Web Developer] - a must-have if you're into web development.
4.  [Greasemonkey] - the much-talked-about tweak-the-web extension that
    allows you to reconfigure any site to look and act the way YOU
    like it. If you're a "power to the people"/"fuck the system" kind of
    guy, this is the extension for you. Grab some ready-made scripts
    from [userscripts.org] or read Mark Pilgrim's [Dive into
    GreaseMonkey] to learn how to roll your own.
5.  [SessionSaver] - never quite got this one to work in Firefox 1.0.x,
    if it does work in 1.5b2 it will instantly become my most
    used extension. I routinely browse with more than 30 tabs open, and
    I'm getting tired of having to "bookmark all tabs" periodically.
6.  [CustomizeGoogle] - haven't investigated this one yet, but it
    looks interesting.
