James Tauber has a blog named [James Tauber : journeyman of some]. The
expression is a twist on the familiar "Jack of All Trades, Master of
None":

> I'm not a jack of all trades.
>
> I'm not a master of none.
>
> I'm a *journeyman of some*.

I still prefer [Bolt Cranks' twist]:

> I am not a jack-of-all-trades. I am an explorer.

as well as my own twists:

> Jack-of-all-trades, choices in spades.

or:

> Jack of no trade, master of one;
>
> Choose the wrong one, you're fucked.
