[DrunkenBlog] is a Mac-centric blog that once in a while holds very
[interesting interviews] with tech-heads from the Mac universe. A couple
of days ago, the mysterious drunkenbatman had a long interview with Wil
Shipley, co-creator of the wonderful [Delicious Library]. Here are a few
delicious snippets:

> \[concerning Apple's Intel switch\]
>
> \[Wil Shipley\] <span style="color: #336600;">I honestly think Apple's
> market share will double within a year of the Intel switch. I'm going
> to sink my money into Apple and Berkshire Hathaway.</span>
>
> \[drunkenbatman\] \[...\] <span style="color: #003366;">Apple's
> marketshare may well double or even triple, but does that mean Mac OS
> X share will do the same? I.E., what if people stop booting into the
> Mac once they're done playing, don't want to deal with dual-booting at
> all, or developers of larger software start telling Mac users to just
> boot into Windows (or boot up an emulator) to save costs?</span>
>
> \[Wil Shipley\] <span style="color: #336600;">They're not going to
> reboot to Windows. Windows sucks dogs and everyone knows it. I don't
> even have to quote the stories of Windows machines getting viruses
> after 10 seconds any more, because everyone has had it happen to them
> or someone they love.</span>
>
> <span style="color: #336600;">They're going to use Wine (or something
> a lot like it) to play games. It's a perfect technology for this at a
> perfect time. Windows programs (or a subset of them) will run in a
> virtual environment on Mac OS X just as Java, Mac Classic, and X11
> programs do right now.</span>
>
> <span style="color: #336600;">The Windows user experience is so much
> worse than Mac OS X that I can't imagine anyone thinking it wasn't
> worth it to boot back. It's like saying, "Hey, it's too much trouble
> to leave the video arcade and go back to our office and get some work
> done... let's just stay here and sit on the sticky chairs, surrounded
> by 14-year-old skateboarders."</span>
>
> \[...\]
>
> \[drunkenbatman\] <span style="color: #003366;">How does the Mac base
> different from your other experiences?</span>
>
> \[Wil Shipley\] <span style="color: #336600;">Mac users love their
> machines; Windows users put up with their machines because they don't
> believe there's anything really better.</span>
>
> <span style="color: #336600;">It's depressing, really, because it's
> like dealing with victims of abuse: "Seriously, there's a better world
> out there, and you deserve it! You don't have to put up with this! You
> can leave! Mac will treat you right!" And their response is right out
> of the textbooks: "Why would I trust Mac? I don't think anything can
> be good after this."</span>
>
> \[drunkenbatman\] <span style="color: #003366;">It's clear that you're
> tied to Mac OS X, and have no interest in porting your software to
> Linux or Windows. As a developer, what would Windows or Linux need to
> kindle your interest?</span>
>
> \[Wil Shipley\] <span style="color: #336600;">A really stable version
> of Cocoa. It's all about the frameworks. People talk about Java vs.
> Objective-C vs. Python vs. whatever, and I think the discussions are
> just idiotic. It's like arguing what kind of needle you want to use on
> a syringe and not paying any attention to what substance you're
> actually injecting yourself with.</span>
>
> <span style="color: #336600;">Frameworks are the substance of
> programming. You build on top of a good one, your program is solid and
> fast and comes together beautifully. You build on top of a bad one,
> your life is miserable, brutish, and short.</span>
>
> \[...\]
>
> \[drunkenbatman\] <span style="color: #003366;">When was the last time
> you looked at say, C\# and the .NET on Windows or say, Mono on
> Linux?</span>
>
> \[Wil Shipley\] <span style="color: #336600;">Honestly, I haven't
> looked at the latest. After years and years of Microsoft promising
> that this set of frameworks was The Next Great Thingâ„¢, I've given up.
> I just don't have the time.</span>
>
> <span style="color: #336600;">They're like the boyfriend who keeps
> coming back and saying, "Really, baby, I went to counseling, and I'm
> better now, just give me one more chance..." I don't want to be one of
> those chicks on Sally Jesse saying, "But I love him!"</span>\
