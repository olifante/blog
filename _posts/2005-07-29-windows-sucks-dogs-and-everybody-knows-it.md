<p><a title="DrunkenBlog" href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/">DrunkenBlog</a> is a Mac-centric blog that once in a while holds very <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/cat_interviews.html">interesting interviews</a> with tech-heads from the Mac universe. A couple of days ago, the mysterious drunkenbatman had a long interview with Wil Shipley, co-creator of the wonderful <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a>. Here are a few delicious snippets:</p>

[concerning Apple's Intel switch]</p>

<p>[Wil Shipley] <span style="color: #336600;">I honestly think Apple's market share will double within a year of the Intel switch. I'm going to sink my money into Apple and Berkshire Hathaway.</span></p>



<p>[drunkenbatman] [...] <span style="color: #003366;">Apple's marketshare may well double or even triple, but does that mean Mac OS X share will do the same? I.E., what if people stop booting into the Mac once they're done playing, don't want to deal with dual-booting at all, or developers of larger software start telling Mac users to just boot into Windows (or boot up an emulator) to save costs?</span></p>

<p>[Wil Shipley] <span style="color: #336600;">They're not going to reboot to Windows. Windows sucks dogs and everyone knows it. I don't even have to quote the stories of Windows machines getting viruses after 10 seconds any more, because everyone has had it happen to them or someone they love.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #336600;">They're going to use Wine (or something a lot like it) to play games. It's a perfect technology for this at a perfect time. Windows programs (or a subset of them) will run in a virtual environment on Mac OS X just as Java, Mac Classic, and X11 programs do right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #336600;">The Windows user experience is so much worse than Mac OS X that I can't imagine anyone thinking it wasn't worth it to boot back. It's like saying, &quot;Hey, it's too much trouble to leave the video arcade and go back to our office and get some work done... let's just stay here and sit on the sticky chairs, surrounded by 14-year-old skateboarders.&quot;</span></p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>[drunkenbatman] <span style="color: #003366;">How does the Mac base different from your other experiences?</span></p>

<p>[Wil Shipley] <span style="color: #336600;">Mac users love their machines; Windows users put up with their machines because they don't believe there's anything really better.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #336600;">It's depressing, really, because it's like dealing with victims of abuse: &quot;Seriously, there's a better world out there, and you deserve it! You don't have to put up with this! You can leave! Mac will treat you right!&quot; And their response is right out of the textbooks: &quot;Why would I trust Mac? I don't think anything can be good after this.&quot;</span></p>

<p>[drunkenbatman] <span style="color: #003366;">It's clear that you're tied to Mac OS X, and have no interest in porting your software to Linux or Windows. As a developer, what would Windows or Linux need to kindle your interest?</span></p>

<p>[Wil Shipley] <span style="color: #336600;">A really stable version of Cocoa. It's all about the frameworks. People talk about Java vs. Objective-C vs. Python vs. whatever, and I think the discussions are just idiotic. It's like arguing what kind of needle you want to use on a syringe and not paying any attention to what substance you're actually injecting yourself with.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #336600;">Frameworks are the substance of programming. You build on top of a good one, your program is solid and fast and comes together beautifully. You build on top of a bad one, your life is miserable, brutish, and short.</span></p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>[drunkenbatman] <span style="color: #003366;">When was the last time you looked at say, C# and the .NET on Windows or say, Mono on Linux?</span></p>

<p>[Wil Shipley] <span style="color: #336600;">Honestly, I haven't looked at the latest. After years and years of Microsoft promising that this set of frameworks was The Next Great Thingâ„¢, I've given up. I just don't have the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #336600;">They're like the boyfriend who keeps coming back and saying, &quot;Really, baby, I went to counseling, and I'm better now, just give me one more chance...&quot; I don't want to be one of those chicks on Sally Jesse saying, &quot;But I love him!&quot;</span><br />
