A entrevista da [entrada anterior] gerou uma [discussão muito viva] no
MetaFilter, na qual surgiram alguns apontadores para vários textos
recentes muito interessantes. Aqui vão os apontadores para alguns deles:

[Iraq's False Promises] por Slavoj Zizek no Foreign Policy

> If you want to understand why the Bush administration invaded Iraq,
> read Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, not the National Security
> Strategy of the United States. Only the twisted logic of dreams can
> explain why the United States thinks that the aggressive pursuit of
> contradictory goals—promoting democracy, affirming U.S. hegemony, and
> ensuring stable energy supplies—will produce success.

[Iraq and the Gulf of Tonkin] por Arnaud de Borchgrave no Washington
Times

> The dust is not about to settle over the intelligence failure in Iraq.
> But it has already blurred our vision about weapons of mass
> destruction (WMDs).\
> There is still time to remind ourselves WMDs were not the principal
> reason for going to war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq; they were the
> pretext. And that's why irrefutable evidence was not the standard.
> Axis of evil regime change was the lodestar.\
> When this writer first heard from prominent neoconservatives in April
> 2002 that war was no longer a question of "if" but "when," the casus
> belli had little to do with WMDs. The Bush administration, they
> explained, starkly and simply, had decided to redraw the geopolitical
> map of the Middle East. The Bush Doctrine of pre-emption had become
> the vehicle for driving axis of evil practitioners out of power.

[The Neocons in Power] por Elizabeth Drew no New York Review of Books

> The conflict within the Bush administration in recent months over
> policy for postwar Iraq has caused much confusion and has already
> damaged the reconstruction effort. The stakes are enormous not just
> for the US and for the people of Iraq, but for the entire Middle East,
> and the rest of the world. Almost from the outset of the Bush
> administration there have been battles between the State Department
> and the Defense Department, but the controversy over postwar Iraq has
> brought out bitterness and knife-wielding of a sort that Washington
> has seldom seen.

[Now They Tell Us] por Michael Massing no New York Review of Books

> In recent months, US news organizations have rushed to expose the Bush
> administration's pre-war failings on Iraq. "Iraq's Arsenal Was Only on
> Paper," declared a recent headline in The Washington Post. "Pressure
> Rises for Probe of Prewar-Intelligence," said The Wall Street Journal.
> "So, What Went Wrong?" asked Time. In The New Yorker, Seymour Hersh
> described how the Pentagon set up its own intelligence unit, the
> Office of Special Plans, to sift for data to support the
> administration's claims about Iraq. And on "Truth, War and
> Consequences," a Frontline documentary that aired last October, a
> procession of intelligence analysts testified to the administration's
> use of what one of them called "faith-based intelligence."
