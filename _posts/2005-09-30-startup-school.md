On September 8, I was casually reading one of Paul Graham's many
eloquent essays when I noticed a link with the text [Startup School]. I
arrived at a simple page that said:

> Are you a [hacker] who has thought about one day starting a startup?
> Then you're invited to a free, one-day startup school this October 15
> in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
>
> We'll have range of [experts] speaking on all the things you need to
> know to start a company: where to get ideas for startups; what to look
> for in a co-founder; how to get funding; how to incorporate a company;
> patent and intellectual property law; how to build something users
> will like; what can go wrong in a startup; what acquirers look for;
> and how the acquisition process works.

I skimmed the text and had to think all of 5 seconds before I found my
self filling the application form with my nano-CV:

I then promptly forgot about it, until last September 27, when an email
arrived which started

> "Thanks for applying to the startup school.  We're happy to report
> you've been accepted."

Tears of joy ran down my cheeks - well, actually they didn't, but I was
really thrilled to discover I was one of the lucky 500 people selected
for this unique and FREE event. I booked a flight from Lisbon to Boston 
that same day - now I just have to find somewhere to sleep in Boston
from Oct 14 to Oct 17.\
