<p>Reading more than a dozen blogs on a periodical basis by manually visiting their sites with a browser is a great way to lose your mental sanity. That's what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator">News Aggregators</a> are for. Enter <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, the king of news aggregators. When I discovered it, I immediately abandoned <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a>, which was and remains one of the best news aggregators for MacOSX. Why did I do it? Because Bloglines is a web application, meaning I can access it from any machine. I regularly move between Macs, PCs and Solaris machines, and Bloglines allows me to keep track of all the stuff I've already read, showing me only the new and unread items. I also use Bloglines for managing my blogroll, i.e. the list of blogs shown on the right-hand side of this blog. Bloglines also lets me publish my blogroll on their site: here's <a href="bloglines.com/public/olifante">olifante's feeds</a>.</p>

<p>Bloglines actually isn't the first web-based news aggregator: the first one I used was Geekboys, a Swedish site that didn't last long. I later moved to Fyuze, then to NewsIsFree, then back to Fyuze, and later to locally installed news aggregators. What sets Bloglines apart from those is its ease of use and good graphical design. I can manage my subscriptions in an explorer-like tree panel, allowing me to keep track of many more blogs than before (over a hundred now). Bloglines gives a much more efficient way of wasting even more time. Procrastinators of world, you know you want it!</p>
