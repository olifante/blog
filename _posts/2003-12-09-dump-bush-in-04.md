Excertos da [Carta de Mefistófeles a Blair]:

"But I have a solution. It is simple, devastating, will unite the party
behind you, will make you a greater world figure than ever and secure
your place in history. Best of all, it will only take one speech,
delivered sometime next year."

"All you need to do is dump Bush in 04."

"Bush is a millstone round your neck. Dump him and with one bound you’ll
be free. Popular with the party again, embraced across Europe. I can
give you glad confident morning again. For just one speech."
