<p>"But I have a solution. It is simple, devastating, will unite the party behind you, will make you a greater world figure than ever and secure your place in history. Best of all, it will only take one speech, delivered sometime next year."</p>

<p>"Bush is a millstone round your neck. Dump him and with one bound you’ll be free. Popular with the party again, embraced across Europe. I can give you glad confident morning again. For just one speech."</p>
