[The 100 Funniest Jokes of All Times]

74, 84, 86 and 88: LOL!!

8, 26 and 52: :-)

94 and 99: WTF?!

My absolute favorite is number 23, a one liner by Henny Youngman:

> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">I was so ugly when I was born, the
> doctor slapped my mother.</span>

Everytime I start to visualize this scene, I burst into loony laughter.
Here's a couple of other notable shorties from the GQ list:

> I went to the psychiatrist, and he says "You're crazy". I tell him I
> want a second opinion. He says, "Okay, you're ugly too!"
>
> After 12 years of therapy my psychiatrist said something that brought
> tears to my eyes... He said, "No hablo ingles."
