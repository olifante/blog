</p>

<p>74, 84, 86 and 88: LOL!!</p>

<p>8, 26 and 52: :-)</p>

<p>94 and 99: WTF?!</p>

<p>My absolute favorite is number 23, a one liner by Henny Youngman:</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">I was so ugly when I was born, the doctor slapped my mother.</span></p></blockquote><p>Everytime I start to visualize this scene, I burst into loony laughter. Here's a couple of other notable shorties from the GQ list:</p>

<blockquote><p>I went to the psychiatrist, and he says
&quot;You're crazy&quot;. I tell him I want a second opinion. He says, &quot;Okay,
you're ugly too!&quot;</p>

<p>After 12 years of therapy my
psychiatrist said something that brought tears to my eyes... He said,
&quot;No hablo ingles.&quot;</p></blockquote>
