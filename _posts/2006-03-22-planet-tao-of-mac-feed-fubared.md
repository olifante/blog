Something's rotten in [Planet Tao of Mac]. My posts are all fubar'ed
when seen from that aggregator, but everything's dandy when seen from
[my blog] or even from [Bloglines]. Could it have something to do with
the Chinese characters I used in a recent post? Have notified Rui, will
investigate further.

**Update:** Somehow some of the problems disappeared, only the [Chinese
post] still shows formatting fondue. No, I was not hallucinating:
