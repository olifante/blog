<p>Something's rotten in <a href="http://planet.taoofmac.com/">Planet Tao of Mac</a>. My posts are all fubar'ed when seen from that aggregator, but everything's dandy when seen from <a href="http://olifante.blogs.com/covil">my blog</a> or even from <a href="http://bloglines.com/preview?siteid=73581">Bloglines</a>. Could it have something to do with the Chinese characters I used in a recent post? Have notified Rui, will investigate further.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Somehow some of the problems disappeared, only the <a href="http://olifante.blogs.com/covil/2006/03/polyphonic_char.html">Chinese post</a> still shows formatting fondue. No, I was not hallucinating:</p>
