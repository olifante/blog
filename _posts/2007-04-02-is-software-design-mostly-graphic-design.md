Today I stumbled upon an excellent essay proposing a new paradigm for
software design:

[Magic Ink - Information Software and the Graphical Interface]

Author Bret Victor argues we've been using Industrial Design as the
wrong paradigm for software design. He splits user-facing software in
three categories:

-   Information Software
-   Manipulation Software
-   Communication Software

He then proceeds to argue that "**Most software is information
software**" and that "**Information software design is graphic
design**".

The essay uses beautiful visual examples to show how Tufte's "**Show the
Data**" principle can be used to reduce the need for interactivity in
user-facing software.

Endearingly, his Movie Showings redesign example shows a movie called
"The Little Schemer" with actors [Car, Cdr], Cons and Cond, a
tongue-in-cheek tribute to the deservedly well-known [compsci classic
book] of the same name:
