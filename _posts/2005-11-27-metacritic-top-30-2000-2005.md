[Metacritic] is a Los Angeles meta-review site: they aggregate reviews
from many standard source, and convert site-specific rating structures
to a standard percentage to produce a weighted average that is hopefully
more representative of some kind of universal good taste and less skewed
by the idiosyncrasies of individual reviewers. Topics covered are music,
films, games, books, dvds and tv shows.

Every year since 2000, they've produced a music top 30 chart. In order
to help me explore interesting music, I used their "Best of" data for
[2000], [2001], [2002], [2003], [2004] and [2005] to produce an
aggregated chart, with 180 entries sorted according to score. Here are
the results:
