Jon Stewart's at it again. Check the [hilarious movie clip] of his
[sketch at The Emmys] about Katrina.

If you haven't watched Jon Stewart's [live dissection of Tucker Carlson]
on CNN, please do the world a service and watch the [movie clip]. The
show was cancelled shortly after this incident.

For a funny indictment of electronic voting, check this [older movie
clip].
