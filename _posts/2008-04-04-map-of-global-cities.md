I found a thought-provoking interactive map of 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-tier
[global cities] produced by the [Globalization and World Cities Study
Group] of Loughborough University:

[]

[![World]][]

The GaWC group uses the term World City, but I prefer the term Global
City -- it's less prone to confusion. Besides the list of alpha, beta
and gamma global cities, the GaWC group also provides a secondary
ranking of [cities possibly on their way to Global City status]:

-   **Relatively strong evidence:** Athens, Auckland, Dublin, Helsinki,
    Luxembourg, Lyon, Mumbai, New Delhi, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro,
    Tel Aviv, Vienna
-   **Some evidence:** Abu Dhabi, Almaty, Birmingham, Bogota,
    Bratislava, Brisbane, Bucharest, Cairo, Cleveland, Cologne, Detroit,
    Dubai, Ho Chi Minh City, Kiev, Lima, **Lisbon**, Manchester,
    Montevideo, Oslo, Riyadh, Rotterdam, Seattle, Stuttgart, The Hague,
    Vancouver
-   **Minimal evidence:** Adelaide, Antwerp, Arhus, Baltimore,
    Bangalore, Bologna, Brasilia, Calgary, Cape Town, Colombo, Columbus,
    Dresden, Edinburgh, Genoa, Glasgow, Gothenburg, Guangzhou, Hanoi,
    Kansas City, Leeds, Lille, Marseille, Richmond, St Petersburg,
    Tashkent, Tehran, Tijuana, Turin, Utrecht, Wellington

I find their positioning of Lisbon in the "**Some evidence**" category
quite puzzling. Ranking Lisbon at the same global-city level as Oslo,
Birmingham and Brisbane seems questionable, to say nothing of bundling
it with cities such as Brisbane, Bucharest, Bratislava(!),
Montevideo(!!) and Almaty(!!!??).

Lisbon is no Manhattan, but it is not exactly a backwater either.
According to Euro Monitor's list of [Top 150 City Destinations] in the
world, Lisbon is placed at a respectable **47th** place, with **1.7
million arrivals per year**, higher than Zurich's 1.4 million and SÃ£o
Paulo's 1.1 million, two cities classified by the GaWC group as beta
global cities.

Lisbon is also the **7th** most [popular city in Europe for meetings and
conventions], according to the International Association Meetings Market
2006 survey of the International Congress & Convention Association:

1.  Vienna - 147 meetings during 2006
2.  Paris - 130
3.  Barcelona - 103
4.  Berlin - 91
5.  Budapest - 86
6.  Prague - 82
7.  Lisbon & Copenhagen - 69 each

Portugal itself ranks **15th** out of 130 in the [Travel & Tourism
Competitiveness Index for 2008], and Lisbon must surely be one of the
two major travel destinations within the country (the other being the
beaches of Algarve).

Of course, tourism and conventions alone do not a Global City make, but
I would still expect a stronger correlation. I don't know all the
criteria the GaWC group uses for their classification, but it seems to
me they need to revisit some of them.
