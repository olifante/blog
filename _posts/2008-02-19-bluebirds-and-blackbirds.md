<p>Another great puzzle:</p>

<p>A collection of bluebirds and blackbirds sit on a wire. <br />
1. There is at least one bird of each type. <br />
2. Each pair of birds with 15 or 20 birds between them are the same color.  </p>

<p>What is the largest number of birds that could be sitting on the wire?</p>
