O artigo [Official U.S. Reaction Compounds the Rage], escrito por um
iraquiano com nacionalidade americana, dá-nos uma visão arrepiante sobre
como é que os eventos actuais estão a ser interpretados pela população
iraquiana:

> The U.S.' self-absorbed angst plays well at home. But where it
> matters, in Iraq and in the Middle East, it only adds fuel to the
> raging fire. Arabs have a favorite expression for such behavior: "He
> slapped me and cried."
>
> \[...\]
>
> Most Iraqis feel their country has been raped twice, once by the U.S.
> military guards at Abu Ghraib and once by the indifference of their
> bosses.
>
> \[...\]
>
> U.S. officials' pretentious displays of disgust over the abuse photos
> have frustrated and angered Iraqis. They know that steps taken in
> early days of the U.S.-led occupation made it inevitable that such
> atrocities would occur. Most notorious was Bremer's Order No. 17,
> which immunized all foreign soldiers in Iraq against any local Iraqi
> scrutiny; practically speaking, coalition authorities recognized a
> complaint against a soldier only if it was filed by a fellow soldier.
>
> \[...\]
>
> But Americans and their allies must understand that Iraq is not a
> pragmatic society when it comes to religion, culture and sexual mores.
> It is never acceptable to touch a woman and then come back later to
> express regret or, worse, offer money.
