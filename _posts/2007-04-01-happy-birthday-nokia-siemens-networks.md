[![]]

Today is the first day of operations of [Nokia Siemens Networks][![]],
the new network communications juggernaut resulting from the [merger] of
Siemens AG's COM division and Nokia's Network Business Group.

April 1st may seem like an unlikely date to start a company, but this
doesn't seem to have hurt Apple, which was [founded] on this same day 31
years ago.

I wish Nokia Siemens Networks a long and prosperous life, not least
because I'm transitioning from Siemens to the new company.

I started working for Siemens Portugal on June 2006, and have since then
been leading a team of developers doing exciting work in mobile TV. It's
been a great 10 months, and I'm eager to discover how the sinergies
generated by the merger can help us jump ahead.

Incidentally, it's no coincidence that my [last post] was written more
than 10 months ago, roughly 20 days before I joined Siemens Portugal.
The effort of diving into my new job left me little energy for blogging.
I now intend to resume blogging on a regular basis, for some undefined
value of regular.
