I just saw Sydney Pollack's movie "The Interpreter". It's awful.

I went to see this film expecting to enjoy it. With such a cast and with
Pollack behind the wheel, what's to fear? A good deal, unfortunately:
The moronic, convoluted and unconvincing plot; the worst acting I've
ever seen from Sean Penn and in particular Nicole Kidman; the pointless
African angle, as if the film had anything to do with it; the clichés
galore; the walking-wounded characters who only speak in hushed tones to
show us how much pain they carry around; the utterly unconvincing
romantic development between Penn and Kidman; the unlikely interpreter
character, who goes from guerrilla to peace loving interpreter and
later, in an amazing (yawn) plot twist, becomes an avenging angel, who
is frustrated as usual at the very end, in order to remain the "good"
character; the Portuguese janitor with the awkward Portuguese phrases
and specious accent;  Nicole Kidman's unbelievably bad french accent
(for a character who is supposed to be a language whiz and to have
studied at Sorbonne); the soundtrack with the African drums; Kidman's
vision of her kid brother; the unbelievably clumsy bus scene with Kuman
and company; the fact that the film has little to do with the UN besides
the locations. Although technically it seems to be well directed and
shot, this film is a disaster.

Avoid at all costs, unless you want to learn how not to tell a story.
