The [Great Scientology Secret] is a South Park clip explaining what
scientologists learn when after years of expensive auditing they are
told about the root of all evil: Xenu, an ancient evil Alien overlord.
Once upon a time, this malevolent creature released tons of engrams upon
our poor suffering earth, which have ever since been seeping into
people's minds and wreaking all kind of havoc and misery. The colossal
stupidity of the hoax that is scientology boggles the mind: I mean, I
know Ron Hubbard was a Sci-Fi writer, but is this really the best he was
able to come up with?
