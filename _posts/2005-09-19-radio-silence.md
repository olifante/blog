I've been kind of silent lately, for several reasons:

1.  Blogs are hard to maintain, but strangely addictive, in an
    obsessive-compulsive sort of way. Somehow I find it liberating to be
    freed from the need to post every day. Maybe that's the only way to
    have a regular audience, as some say, but Google seems to be my main
    reader and it seems to be more interested in quality than quantity
    of production;
2.  I've grown tired of simply being a linkblog that only comments on
    what others do and adds no real original value;
3.  Increasingly, I feel the need to \*do\* things instead of \*talking
    about\* things, although my personal inclination is usually for
    the latter. Blogging is fun, but how much does it accomplish?
4.  I've been spending a lot of time learning a few new things, such as
    spoken Mandarin Chinese, the Ruby programming language, and the
    poster child of the year, the Ruby on Rails web development
    platform;
5.  I've been doing a lot of training and some contracting work lately,
    most of it related to Sun's Java Enterprise System, with a
    sprinkling of J2EE, Java programming and Sun Cluster. Lots of
    information to refresh/assimilate/update, not much time left for
    writing;
6.  Several ideas about starting my own business keep coming back to
    haunt me. Maybe I shouldÂ  unglue my eyeballs from the web and do
    something about it.
