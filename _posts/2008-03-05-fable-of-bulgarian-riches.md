Keeping in topic with my last post, I've been browsing through the [UBS
Price and Earnings report for 2006], the latest available. There's lots
of interesting rankings and figures, but not many surprises regarding
Portugal. We seem to float around the middle for most rankings. The
report has an elegant design, with a few unexpected typos here and
there. More importantly, the report could have benefitted from some
proof-reading by someone who actually knows a thing or two about
European countries. Witness the following passage:

> Sofia, Bulgaria, is typical of many cities in our survey. An
> elementary school teacher there earns just under USD 2100 per month,
> while a secretary in the private sector takes home almost double that
> amount. At just under USD 7700 a product manager in the Bulgarian
> capital earns substantially more â€“ due mainly to the fact that this
> job profile is in demand, particularly among international or large
> domestic companies.

This struck me as highly surprising. I've never been to Sofia or
Bulgaria, but these values seemed much too high for a developing
ex-communist country that just recently joined the EU. A couple of
tables in the appendix tell a different story:

-   Gross incomes of primary school teachers in Sofia: USD 2100 per year
-   Gross incomes of product managers in Sofia: USD 7700 per year

These values are more compatible with my intuition and with several
other figures for Sofia presented in the report. You might then say it
was a simple typo: someone wrote "USD 2100 per month" when they meant
per year. The problem is that the real yearly salaries are far from
typical, as is stated in the above quote - they fall at the very bottom
of the table for the surveyed cities. I am left with the impression that
the person who wrote this passage really thought these were monthly
salaries, and consequently knew close to nothing about Bulgaria.
