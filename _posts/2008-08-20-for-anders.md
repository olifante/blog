<span>[For Anders] by [olifante]</span>

I'm publishing another piano piece, this time dedicated to my friend
Anders Bech, who acted as a mentor when I started playing the piano 20
years ago in Denmark. Here's Anders having fun with a Keith Jarrett
piece (from the KÃ¶ln Concert, if I'm not mistaken):

[![Anders]]

Anders introduced me to several easy piano pieces which I came to enjoy
a lot, including my first modern piano pieces (by composers such as Paul
Hindemith, Harald Genzmer, Aram Khatchaturian and Igor Stravinsky) and
my first jazz piano pieces.

Like "[Sorrow for Sara]", "For Anders" was typeset with [LilyPond
