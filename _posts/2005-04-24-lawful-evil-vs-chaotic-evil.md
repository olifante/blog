<p>The article <a title="A Tiny Revolution: How America Works" href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000478.html#more">A Tiny Revolution: How America Works</a> gives an interesting insight into the level of inbreeding of american elites, but what really cracked me up was one of the comments:</p><blockquote><p>As I like to say, the Democrats and Republicans have generally
represented the sane evil people and the insane evil people,
respectively. Their long-running argument goes like this:

</p>

<p><em><strong>REPUBLICANS:</strong> Let's kill everyone and take their money!<br />
<strong>DEMOCRATS:</strong> I like the way you're thinking. I really do. But if we keep
at least SOME of them alive and working for us, we can make even MORE
money in the long run!<br />
<strong>REPUBLICANS:</strong> You commie!</em></p></blockquote>
