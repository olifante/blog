While digging through some old papers, I found a copy of what is
probably my favorite puzzle. I googled it but couldn't find any
references, so I'm posting it. If anyone knows who authored it, let me
know.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 31 people around a table, each with a square of a given colour
on the forehead. Each one must find out what his own colour is, without
communicating in any way with the others.

Successive rings are sounded, and each person must leave the table on
finding out what his colour is.

-   On the first ring, four persons left.
-   On the second, everybody in red left.
-   On the third, no one got up.
-   On the fourth, at least one person got up.

How many rings were sounded after that one?

Remember that everybody passed the test.

Additionally, the leader and his sister left before the last ring (the
one that empties the table) and wore different colours.
